# Hypertension Data Analysis 📊

This project was completed as part of our 2nd semester course on **Probability and Statistics** at BML Munjal University. It involves a detailed analysis of hypertension data using statistical techniques and linear regression.

## 📌 Problem Statement
To analyze hypertension data using statistical and probabilistic methods to identify patterns, correlations, and risk factors associated with high blood pressure in a sample population. We also apply linear regression for prediction.

## 👩‍💻 Team Members
- Sushmita S M  
- Tanisha Mittal  
- Yeshy Bansal  
- Diksha Pathak

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset
We used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle:  
[Health Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prosperchuks/health-dataset)

## 📈 Analysis Highlights
- Descriptive Statistics of blood pressure and age
- Visualizations: Histograms, Pie Charts, Correlation Heatmap
- Hypothesis testing (Mean BP ≠ 120 mmHg)
- Linear Regression (Age vs. Blood Pressure)
- Prediction model:  
  **ŷ = 0.03(age) + 130.18**

## 📚 Results & Insights
- 32.4% of individuals were hypertensive (≥140 mmHg)
- Weak but positive correlation between age and blood pressure
- Predictive model helps identify at-risk individuals
